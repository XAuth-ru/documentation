# 2. Why another project?

XAuth was born out of passion and a genuine desire to make a difference in the field of authentication solutions. When asked why not contribute to an existing project instead, there are two primary reasons:

1. Unique Approach: XAuth's decentralized and secure authentication system offers a distinct approach to ensuring privacy, security, and anonymity, setting it apart from other projects in the market.

2. Customization and Control: Developing XAuth as a standalone project allows for greater flexibility, control, and the ability to tailor the solution to specific needs and requirements, thus delivering a more focused and specialized authentication experience.

In summary, XAuth was created as a separate project to bring a unique and innovative approach to authentication, while allowing for customization and control that might not be possible when contributing to an existing project.
